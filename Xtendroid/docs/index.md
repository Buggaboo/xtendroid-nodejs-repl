Activities and Fragments
------------------------

You can bind all the view widgets in an Activity layout file to the code automatically by using the @AndroidActivity annotation, as follows:

```xtend
@AndroidActivity(R.layout.my_activity) class MyActivity {

	@OnCreate
	def init(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
		myTextView.text = "some text"
	}

}

```

Here, you specify the layout resource using the ```@AndroidActivity``` annotation, and Xtendroid will automatically parse the layout file and create getters for all the controls within the layout. This will be immediately accessible in the IDE (you will see the controls in your outline view and code-complete list). It will also auto-generate the ```onCreate()``` method if it doesn't exist, extend from ```Activity``` class, and load the layout into the Activity. Finally, it will look for any methods with the ```@OnCreate``` annotation, and call them within the ```onCreate()``` method once the controls are ready to be accessed. This annotation also ensures that all ```android:onClick``` method references in the layout exist in the activity, and if not, marks the activity with an error.

You can do something similar in a fragment using the ```@AndroidFragment``` annotation, but beware that in a fragment, the layout is loaded in the ```onCreateView()``` method and the controls are only ready to be accessed in ```onViewCreated()``` or ```onActivityCreated()``` methods. If you simply use the ```@OnCreate``` annotation on your method that instantiates the fragment, this will all be taken care of for you:

```xtend
@AndroidFragment(R.layout.my_fragment) class MyFragment {

	@OnCreate
	def init(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
		myTextView.text = "some text"
	}

}

```

The ```@AndroidView``` annotation is a simple way to access your views inside an activity or fragment, without using the above class-level annotations, e.g.

```xtend
class MyActivity extends Activity {
   @AndroidView TextView myTextView  // maps to R.id.my_text_view

   override onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
      setContentView(R.layout.my_fragment)
      myTextView.text = "Hello, world!"
   }
}
```

Background tasks using AsyncTask
--------------------------------

A class called ```BgTask``` is provided, that extends the standard ```AsyncTask``` and works in much the same way, but provides lambda parameters for the background task and the UI task, thus reducing boilerplate:

```xtend
new BgTask<String>.runInBg([|
   // this bit runs in a background thread
   return getSomeString()
],[result|
   // this runs in the UI thread
   toast("Got back: " + result) // note how toast() works here too!
])
```

ProgressDialog is also handled automatically when using this syntax:

```xtend
val progressBar = new ProgressDialog(...)

new BgTask<String>.runInBgWithProgress(progressBar, [|
   // this bit runs in a background thread, progressDialog automatically displayed
   var retVal = fetchStringFromSomewhere()

   // update progress UI from background thread
   runOnUiThread[| progressBar.progress = 10 ]

   return retVal // return keyword is optional
],[result|
   // this runs in the UI thread, progressDialog automatically dismissed afterwards
   toast("Got back: " + result)
])
```

No ```onProgressUpdate``` method is needed, since it is trivial to use the ```runOnUiThread``` method instead, as shown above.  Handling errors in a background task is made easy: you can simply pass a third lambda function that will be executed (in the UI thread) if an error occurs during the background task:

```xtend
new BgTask<String>.runInBg([|
   // this runs in the background thread
   fetchStringFromSomewhere()
],[result|
   // this runs in the UI thread
   toast("Got back: " + result)
],[error|
   // this runs in the UI thread
   toast("Oops, this went wrong: " + error.message)
)
```

>Note: Since Honeycomb, Android has defaulted to using a single thread for all AsyncTasks, because too many developers were writing non-thread-safe code. BgTask changes that, so that multiple AsyncTasks will run simultaneously using the THREAD_POOL_EXECUTOR, so be careful to write thread-safe code.


Shared Preferences
------------------

If you are using ```SharedPreferences```, and you have a ```PreferenceActivity``` to allow the user to change app settings, then the ```BasePreferences``` class and ```@AndroidPreference``` annotation makes it super-easy to access the settings in your activity:

Create a ```Settings``` class:
```xtend
@AndroidPreference class Settings {
   boolean enabled = true // maps to preference "enabled"
   String authToken = ""  // maps to preference "auth_token"
}
```

The ```@AndroidPreference``` annotation will automatically make the class extend ```BasePreferences```, add getters/setters for each *private* and *non-annotated* field that maps by name to the appropriate resource in your settings XML file, and finally creates a static getter method named ```get[Your class name]``` that gives you the syntactic sugar to use it in any activity or fragment, as follows:

Now you can use the Settings class in any Activity:
```xtend
import static extension Settings.*

// elsewhere in activity or fragment
if (settings.enabled) {
   settings.authToken = "new auth token" // How cool is this?
}
```

Whoa! Where did the ```settings``` object/keyword come from in the code above? It is a reference to the static ```getSettings(Context context)``` method that was automatically added to the ```Settings``` class by the annotation, and then statically imported as an extension method. In Xtend:

```xtend
// this
Settings.getSettings(context).enabled = true

// can be reduced to this by import static extension Settings.*
getSettings(context).enabled = true

// which is the same as this (extension method)
context.getSettings().enabled = true

// which, in an activity is the same as
this.getSettings().enabled = true

// since "this" is implicit, that becomes
getSettings().enabled = true

// and Xtend gives further syntax sugar for that, so it becomes
settings.enabled = true
```

Outside an activity or fragment, when a ```Context``` object is available, you can simply append the context object as follows:
```xtend
import static extension Settings.*

// elsewhere in the service/receiver
if (context.settings.enabled) {
   context.settings.authToken = "new auth token"
}
```

Bean adapter
------------

Do you have a list of Java beans that you want to display inside a ListView? The `BeanAdapter` makes this super easy!

Layout for each row - row_user.xml:
```xml
<LinearLayout ... >
 <TextView android:id="@+id/first_name" .../>
 <TextView android:id="@+id/last_name" .../>
 <ImageView android:id="@+id/avatar" .../>
</LinearLayout>
```

Java bean containing the data (fields map by name to the layout above):
```xtend
class User {
  @Property String firstName
  @Property String lastName
  @Property Bitmap avatar
}
```

In the Activity:
```xtend
var List<User> users = getUsers(...) // load the beans from somewhere
var adapter = new BeanAdapter<User>(this, R.layout.row_user, users)
userList.adapter = adapter // assuming the ListView is R.id.user_list
```

The list will now display the data. If you need to add some presentation logic, for example to display a formatted date, simply add a method to the bean (or a presenter sub-class) to do it (e.g. ```def getFormattedDate() {...}``` and then display it in the list by naming your view appropriately, e.g. ```<TextView android:id="@+id/formatted_date" .../>```

Database
--------

Database handling is made much easier thanks to the aBatis project - a fork of this project is included in Xtendroid with some syntactic sugar provided by the `BaseDbService` class for Xtend. Let's look at typical usage:

Create a bean for some data you want to store:
```xtend
class User {
  @Property String firstName
  @Property String lastName
  @Property int age

  override toString() {
      firstName + " " + lastName
  }
}
```

Create some SQL strings in res/values folder, e.g. in sqlmaps.xml:
```xml
<resources>
    <string name="dbInitialize">
        create table users (
           id integer primary key,
           firstName text not null,
           lastName text not null,
           age number
        );
    </string>

    <string name="dbGetOlderThan">
      select * from users
      where age > #age#
      order by age asc
    </string>
</resources>
```

Note that the column names in the database are exactly the same as the field names in the bean. The special string name `dbInitialize` is used the first time the db is created.

Create a `DbService` class you will use to interact with the database:
```xtend
@AndroidDatabase class DbService {

   new(Context context) {
      super(context, "mydatabase", 1) // mydatabase.db is created with version 1
   }

   // override onUpgrade() to manage database migrations

   // add DAO methods here, e.g. findUsers(), saveUser(), etc.
}
```

The `@AndroidDatabase` annotation will automatically extend the `BaseDbService` class, make the constructor protected, and add two `getDb()` convenience methods for you for use in activities and fragments. Note that `BaseDbService` ultimately extends `android.database.sqlite.SQLiteOpenHelper`, so you can use your normal Android database code too. To handle database migrations, you can override the `onUpgrade()` method.

Now you are ready to play! Here are some examples:
```xtend
import static extension DbService.*

// get all users order by lastName
var users = db.findAll("users", "lastName asc", User)
users.forEach [user|
   Log.d("db", "Got user: " + user)
]

// get all users older than 18 (uses SQL defined above)
var adults = db.executeForBeanList(R.string.dbGetOlderThan,
   #{ 'age' -> 18 }, User)
adults.forEach [adult|
   Log.d("db", "Got user: " + adult)
]

// alternative to above without defining an SQL string
adults = db.findByFields("users", #{ 'age >' -> 18 },
    "age asc", User)

// can also do paging by specifying a limit and offset, e.g.
// get top 6 to top 10 users 18 or younger
adults = db.findByFields("users", #{ 'age <=' -> 18 }, "age desc",
    5, 5, User)

// insert a record
var johnId = db.insert("users", #{
   'firstName' -> 'John',
   'lastName' -> 'Doe',
   'age' -> 43
})

// get back this user
var john = db.findById("users", johnId, User)
toast("Hi " + john)

// update this user
db.update("users", #{'lastName' -> 'Smith'}, johnId)

// delete this user
db.delete("users", johnId)

// Suppose you have a million users and want to display them in a list.
// You can do so using the optimized lazyFindAll() and lazyFindByFields() methods
// They use a pre-allocated buffer to avoid garbage collection, and load
// batches of data at a time
var aMillionUsers = db.lazyFindAll("users", null, User)
listView.adapter = new BeanAdapter(activity, R.layout.list_row, aMillionUsers)
```

JSON handling
-------------

You can easily create a bean to hold and parse JSON data. This bean will simply
store the `JSONObject` passed into the constructor without parsing the data into fields.
The data is then parsed on-demand and cached, which makes it more efficient for use in
`Adapter` classes (quick load time, minimal garbage collection, parse on-demand).

>Note: This can become memory-inefficient if you only need a small amount of data from the JSON response
(and you discard the rest), but in that case, you are wasting the user's bandwidth and
should seek to improve the JSON API call.

Creating a JSON bean is done using the ```@AndroidJson``` annotation, as in this example:

```xtend
@AndroidJson class NewsItem {
	String url
	String title
	long id
	boolean published
}
```

The annotation creates a constructor (that takes the JSONObject), and generates lazy-parsing getters for each *private* and *non-annotated* field. You can then load JSON into the bean and use it, as in this example:

```xtend
var jsonResponse = '''{"url":"http://one.com", "title": "One", "id": 1, "published": true}'''
var newsItem = new NewsItem(new JSONObject(jsonResponse))
toast(newsItem.title) // JSON parsed here and cached for later use
```

Nested JSON beans are supported (you can have a field that is another bean annotated with the ```@AndroidJson``` annotation). See the
[JsonTest](../../XtendroidTest/XtendroidTestCasesTest/src/org/xtendroid/xtendroidtest/test/JsonTest.xtend) for more.

In addition to using it at the class-level, you can also use it at the field-level to specify additional parameters, like date format or property name, as in this example:

```xtend
@AndroidJson JsonData {
	String title

	@AndroidJson("yyyy-MM-dd") // date format
	Date createdAt

	@AndroidJson("createdBy") // we want to map "createdBy" json property to "author" field
	String author
}
```

>Note: The ```@JsonProperty``` annotation has been deprecated in favour of ```@AndroidJson```.

Intents and Bundles
-------------------

The member-level `@BundleProperty` annotation, will create a convenience methods for extracting a value from a Bundle or Intent.

If a `@BundleProperty` is applied to a member of an Activity then the generated convenience method will be applied to the intent of the Activity. If applied to a Fragment, then it will be applied to the Bundle (through the `getArguments()` method). If applied to a bean or a Service or any other type other than an Activity or Fragment, then the annotation will attempt to find an Intent among the members and do the same.

Suppose an Activity is expecting a "country" bundle extra, but will default to "South Africa" if not found:

```xtend
class MyActivity extends Activity {
	@BundleProperty String country = "South Africa"
   @BundleProperty String category

   override onStart() {
      super.onStart()
      toast("Using country " + country + ", category " + category)
   }
}
```

Now you can call the activity and send the data in an Intent:

```xtend
var intent = new Intent(this, MyActivity)
MyActivity.putCountry(intent, "Finland")
MyActivity.putCategory(intent, "Sports")
startActivity(intent)
```

The above also works for using an arguments Bundle for Fragments too.

```xtend
var bundle = new Bundle
MyActivity.putCountry(bundle, "Finland")
MyActivity.putCategory(bundle, "Sports")

// set bundle as arguments, etc.
```

Parcelables
-----------

Currently, the `@AndroidParcelable` is a type-level (read: class) annotation that ensures that all the member fields will be serialized using the android Parcel way of serializing stuff.

All you need to do is just slap the annotation on top of the bean, and pass the Parcelable through an Intent. Here's an example:

```xtend
@AndroidParcelable
class ParcelableData {
	public int age
	public long createdAt
	public float likeAButterfly
	public String likeABee

	override toString() {
		'''«age», «createdAt», «likeAButterfly», «likeABee»'''
	}
}
```

Now this Parcelable can be added to an Intent:

```xtend
var p = new ParcelableData
p.age = 1
p.createdAt = new Date().time
p.likeAButterfly = 0.1234f
p.likeABee = "Bzzzz"

var intent2 = new Intent(this, AnotherActivity)
intent2.putExtra("parcel", p)
startActivity(intent2)
```

The receiving Fragment or Activity can retrieve the data using `Intent.getParcelableExtra("parcel")`.

Utilities
---------

AlertUtils makes prompts and confirmation dialog boxes easy
```xtend
import static extension org.xtendroid.utils.AlertUtils.*

toast("Upload started!")
toastLong("No internet connection")

confirm("Are you sure you want to exit?") [|
    finish
]
```

ViewUtils make getting widgets from views/activities/fragments/dialogs easier by eliminating the type-casting
```xtend
import static extension org.xtendroid.utils.ViewUtils.*

var Button myButton = getView(R.id.my_button)
var TextView myText = getView(R.id.my_text)
```

TimeUtils helps with using java.util.Date
```xtend
import static extension org.xtendroid.utils.TimeUtils.*

var Date yesterday = 24.hours.ago
var Date tomorrow = 24.hours.fromNow
var Date futureDate = now + 48.days + 20.hours + 2.seconds
if (futureDate - now < 24.hours) {
    // we are in the future!
}
```

The `@AddLogTag` annotation generates a `TAG` member for use in logging, which will contain the class name, or the specified value:

```xtend
@AddLogTag("optional") class MyActivity {
   def someMethod() {
      Log.d(TAG, "Some debug log message")
   }
}
```
